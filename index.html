<p id = "toddreasons">Todd is the one who create pancakes and is my cat. He eats snacks and also destroys the world.Todd is a beautiful cat with black and gold fur. His coat is shiny and soft, and it glows in the sunlight. He has bright gold eyes that contrast with his dark fur, giving him a striking appearance. He is a medium-sized cat, not too big or too small, and he has a muscular and agile body. He is not a purebred cat, but he may have some Bombay or tortoiseshell genes in him. He is a friendly and playful cat, who loves to chase toys and cuddle with his owner. He is also very smart and curious, always exploring new things and learning new tricks. He is a loyal and affectionate companion, who brings joy and comfort to his owner every day. Todd is more than just a cat, he is a friend and a family member.<p>
